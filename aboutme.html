    <h2>
        MY BACKGROUND
    </h2>
    <p>
        What I have accomplished so far
I am currently, studying bachelor of commerce (Sales and Marketing) at the university of Nairobi,<br>
my interest in sales and marketing has helped me to develop and hone my interests as an entrepreneur <br>
and an online bettor with experience spanning over 4 years.

I have been privilidged enough to work for two companies: Spectrum Newtwork international and VASPRO <br>
as the sales executive in both companies. Most of my time has been spent in pursuing my entrepreneurial <br>
journey as I have always admired to make a great impact to humanity that supersedes most companies <br>
visions and mission which is to generate profit at the expense of everything else.

My desire to join Moringa, was motivated by my desire to escape the 8am-5pm rat race where an <br>
individual gets to earn based on the amount of hours they work rather than on the value they bring to <br>
the market place be it skills,accumulated experience or connections. Going through life as an <br>
entrepreneur I have always known that profits supersede wages and my efforts are geared towards <br>
gaining skills that can enable me to gain a competitive edge to compete universally.
